description: Create a new custom reviewer from a natural language description.
name: "OCR: Create Reviewer"
category: Code Review
tags: [ocr, reviewers, create]

**Usage**
```
/ocr-create-reviewer {name} --focus "{description}"
```

**Examples**
```
create-reviewer rust-safety --focus "Memory safety, ownership patterns, lifetime management, unsafe block auditing"
create-reviewer api-design --focus "REST API design, backwards compatibility, versioning, error response consistency"
create-reviewer graphql --focus "Schema design, resolver efficiency, N+1 queries, type safety"
```

**What it does**

Creates a new reviewer markdown file in `.ocr/skills/references/reviewers/`, following the standard reviewer template structure, and automatically syncs the metadata so the dashboard can see the new reviewer.

**Steps**

1. **Parse arguments**: Extract the reviewer name and `--focus` description from the arguments.
   - Normalize the name to a slug: lowercase, hyphens for spaces, alphanumeric + hyphens only
   - Example: "API Design" → `api-design`

2. **Check for duplicates**: Verify `.ocr/skills/references/reviewers/{slug}.md` does NOT already exist.
   - If it exists, report: "Reviewer `{slug}` already exists. Edit the file directly at `.ocr/skills/references/reviewers/{slug}.md`."
   - Stop — do not overwrite.

3. **Read the template** (REQUIRED — this is the source of truth for reviewer structure):
   Read `.ocr/skills/assets/reviewer-template.md`. This file defines the exact sections, ordering, and format every reviewer MUST follow. Do not invent sections or skip sections — adhere to the template.

4. **Read exemplars**: Read 2-3 existing reviewer files from `.ocr/skills/references/reviewers/` as style reference. Good choices:
   - One holistic reviewer (e.g., `architect.md` or `fullstack.md`)
   - One specialist reviewer close to the requested domain (if applicable)
   - Study the tone, section depth, and specificity level

5. **Generate the reviewer file**: Write a complete reviewer markdown file that follows the template structure from step 3:
   - Starts with `# {Display Name} Reviewer` (title case, no "Principal" prefix — all reviewers are senior by default)
   - Contains every section from the template (`## Your Focus Areas`, `## Your Review Approach`, `## What You Look For`, `## Your Output Style`, `## Agency Reminder`)
   - Uses specific, actionable language (not generic advice)
   - Reflects the user's `--focus` description as the primary lens
   - Matches the depth and tone of the exemplars from step 4

6. **Write the file**: Save to `.ocr/skills/references/reviewers/{slug}.md`

7. **Sync metadata**: After writing the file, run the sync-reviewers workflow to update `reviewers-meta.json`.
   Follow the instructions in `.ocr/commands/sync-reviewers.md` — this reads ALL reviewer files (including the one you just created), extracts metadata with semantic understanding, and pipes through the CLI for validated persistence.

8. **Report**: Confirm the new reviewer was created with:
   - Name and slug
   - Focus areas extracted
   - Tier classification (`custom` for user-created reviewers)
   - Total reviewer count after sync

**Important**

- Do NOT use the `Principal` prefix in the title — all reviewers are assumed to be senior/principal level by default.
- Follow the exact template structure from the exemplars — consistency matters for the dashboard parser.
- The `--focus` description is guidance, not a literal copy. Transform it into well-structured focus areas and review checklists.
- Always run the sync step — the dashboard depends on `reviewers-meta.json` being up to date.
- The `ocr` CLI path may be provided in the CLI Resolution section above. If so, use that path instead of bare `ocr`.
