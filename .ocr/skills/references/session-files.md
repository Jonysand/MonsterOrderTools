# Session File Manifest

> **This is the authoritative reference for session file naming.** All other documentation should reference this file for file names and structure.

## Session Directory Structure

Every OCR session creates files in `.ocr/sessions/{session-id}/`:

```
.ocr/sessions/{YYYY-MM-DD}-{branch}/
├── discovered-standards.md # Merged project context (shared across rounds)
├── requirements.md         # User-provided requirements (if any, shared)
├── context.md              # Phase 2+3: Change summary + Tech Lead guidance (shared)

        ├── discourse.md
        ├── round-meta.json
        └── final.md
```

## Review Rounds

OCR uses a **round-first architecture** where all round-specific artifacts live under `rounds/round-{n}/`. This makes multi-round reviews a first-class concept.

**Round behavior**:
- First `/ocr-review` creates `rounds/round-1/` with `reviews/`, `discourse.md`, `final.md`
- Subsequent `/ocr-review` on same day/branch creates `rounds/round-{n+1}/`
- Previous rounds are preserved (never overwritten)
- Each round has its own `discourse.md` and `final.md`
- SQLite tracks `current_round` via `ocr state show`; round metadata derived from filesystem

**Shared vs per-round/run artifacts**:
| Shared (session root) | Per-round (`rounds/round-{n}/`) | Per-run (`map/runs/run-{n}/`) |
|----------------------|--------------------------------|-------------------------------|
| `discovered-standards.md` | `reviews/*.md` | `topology.md` |
| `requirements.md` | `discourse.md` | `flow-analysis.md` |
| `context.md` | `final.md` | `requirements-mapping.md` |
| | | `map.md` |

**When to use multiple rounds**:
- Author addresses feedback and requests re-review
- Scope changes mid-review
- Different reviewer team composition needed

## Map Runs

OCR uses a **run-based architecture** for maps, parallel to review rounds.

**Run behavior**:
- First `/ocr-map` creates `map/runs/run-1/` with map artifacts
- Subsequent `/ocr-map` on same day/branch creates `map/runs/run-{n+1}/`
- Previous runs are preserved (never overwritten)
- Each run produces a complete `map.md`
- SQLite tracks `current_map_run` via `ocr state show`; run metadata derived from filesystem

**Map artifacts per run**:
| File | Phase | Description |
|------|-------|-------------|
| `topology.md` | 2 | File categorization and section groupings |
| `flow-analysis.md` | 3 | Upstream/downstream dependency tracing |
| `requirements-mapping.md` | 4 | Requirements coverage matrix (if requirements provided) |
| `map-meta.json` | 5 | Structured map data (written by CLI via `map-complete --stdin`) |
| `map.md` | 5 | Final synthesized Code Review Map (presentation artifact) |

**When to use multiple runs**:
- Changeset has evolved since last map
- Different requirements context needed
- Fresh analysis desired after code updates

## File Specifications

### Required Files

| File | Phase | Description | Used By |
|------|-------|-------------|---------|
| `discovered-standards.md` | 1 | Merged project context from config + references | All reviewers |
| `context.md` | 2 | Change summary, diff analysis, Tech Lead guidance | All reviewers |
| `rounds/round-{n}/reviews/{type}-{n}.md` | 4 | Individual reviewer outputs | Discourse, Synthesis |
| `rounds/round-{n}/discourse.md` | 6 | Cross-reviewer discussion results | Synthesis |
| `rounds/round-{n}/round-meta.json` | 7 | Structured review data (written by CLI via `round-complete --stdin`) | Dashboard |
| `rounds/round-{n}/final.md` | 7 | Synthesized final review | Show, Post commands |

### Optional Files

| File | When Created | Description |
|------|--------------|-------------|
| `requirements.md` | Phase 1 | User-provided requirements, specs, or acceptance criteria |

## Reviewer File Naming

**Pattern**: `{type}-{n}.md`

- `{type}`: One of `principal`, `quality`, `security`, `testing`, `ephemeral`, or custom reviewer name
- `{n}`: Sequential number starting at 1

**Examples** (for round 1):
```
rounds/round-1/reviews/principal-1.md
rounds/round-1/reviews/principal-2.md
rounds/round-1/reviews/quality-1.md
rounds/round-1/reviews/quality-2.md
rounds/round-1/reviews/security-1.md
rounds/round-1/reviews/testing-1.md
rounds/round-1/reviews/performance-1.md   # Custom reviewer
rounds/round-1/reviews/ephemeral-1.md     # Ephemeral reviewer (from --reviewer)
rounds/round-1/reviews/ephemeral-2.md     # Ephemeral reviewer (from --reviewer)
```

**Rules**:
- Always lowercase
- Use hyphens, not underscores
- Instance numbers are sequential per reviewer type
- Custom reviewers follow the same `{type}-{n}.md` pattern
- Ephemeral reviewers (from `--reviewer`) use the `ephemeral-{n}` pattern
- Ephemeral reviewers are NOT persisted to `reviewers-meta.json` or the reviewers directory

## Phase-to-File Mapping

| Phase | Phase Name | Files to Create/Update |
|-------|------------|------------------------|
| 1 | Context Discovery | `discovered-standards.md`, `requirements.md` (if provided) |
| 2 | Change Analysis | `context.md`, call `ocr state transition` |
| 3 | Tech Lead Analysis | Update `context.md` with guidance, call `ocr state transition` |
| 4 | Parallel Reviews | `rounds/round-{n}/reviews/{type}-{n}.md` for each reviewer, call `ocr state transition` |
| 5 | Aggregation | (Inline analysis), call `ocr state transition` |
| 6 | Discourse | `rounds/round-{n}/discourse.md`, call `ocr state transition` |
| 7 | Synthesis | Pipe data to `ocr state round-complete --stdin` (writes `round-meta.json`), write `final.md` |
| 8 | Presentation | Call `ocr state close` |

## State Transitions and File Validation

When calling `ocr state transition`, verify the corresponding file exists:

| Phase | Verify file exists |
|---------------------------|-------------------|
| `"context"` | `discovered-standards.md` |
| `"change-context"` | `context.md` |
| `"analysis"` | `context.md` (with Tech Lead guidance) |
| `"reviews"` | At least 2 files in `rounds/round-{current_round}/reviews/` |
| `"discourse"` | `rounds/round-{current_round}/discourse.md` |
| `"synthesis"` | `rounds/round-{current_round}/round-meta.json`, `rounds/round-{current_round}/final.md` |

## Session ID Format

**Pattern**: `{YYYY-MM-DD}-{branch-name}`

> **Shorthand**: In documentation, `{id}` and `{session-id}` are aliases for the full `{YYYY-MM-DD}-{branch-name}` format.

- Date in ISO format (YYYY-MM-DD)
- Branch name with `/` replaced by `-`

**Examples**:
```
2026-01-27-main
2026-01-27-feat-add-auth
2026-01-27-fix-bug-123
```

**Generation**:
```bash
SESSION_ID="$(date +%Y-%m-%d)-$(git branch --show-current | tr '/' '-')"
```

## File Content Requirements

### Session State

Session state is stored in SQLite at `.ocr/data/ocr.db`. Use `ocr state show` to inspect current state. See `session-state.md` for the full data model.

### Reviewer Files

Each `rounds/round-{n}/reviews/{type}-{n}.md` must include:
- Summary section
- Findings with severity, location, and suggestions
- What's Working Well section
- Questions for Other Reviewers section

See `references/reviewer-task.md` for complete output format.

### final.md

Must include:
- Verdict (APPROVE / REQUEST CHANGES / NEEDS DISCUSSION)
- Blockers section (if any)
- Suggestions section
- Requirements Assessment (if requirements provided)
- Clarifying Questions section
- Individual Reviews table with file references

See `references/final-template.md` for complete template.

## CLI Dependencies

The `ocr progress` CLI depends on these exact file names:

| CLI Feature | Files Read |
|-------------|-----------|
| Session detection | `ocr state show` / SQLite |
| Phase tracking | SQLite → `current_phase` |
| Current round | SQLite → `current_round` (reconciled with filesystem) |
| Reviewer progress | `rounds/round-{n}/reviews/*.md` file existence |
| Round completion | `rounds/round-{n}/final.md` existence |
| Elapsed time | SQLite → `started_at` |

**Filesystem as truth**: The CLI derives round metadata from the filesystem, using SQLite as the primary state store. Round-level details are always reconciled against the filesystem by:
1. Enumerating `rounds/round-*/` to count rounds
2. Checking `final.md` presence to determine completion
3. Listing `reviews/*.md` to identify reviewers

**IMPORTANT**: Non-standard file names will break progress tracking.
