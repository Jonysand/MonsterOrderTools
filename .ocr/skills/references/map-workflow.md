# OCR Map Workflow

Complete 6-phase process for generating a Code Review Map.

> **CRITICAL**: You MUST call `ocr state transition` **BEFORE starting work** on each phase. Transition the `current_phase` and `phase_number` immediately when entering a new phase.

> **PREREQUISITE**: The `ocr` CLI must be installed (`npm install -g @open-code-review/cli`) or accessible via `npx`. Every phase transition calls `ocr state transition`, which requires the CLI.

---

## Overview

The Code Review Map is a **human-facing navigation tool** for large, complex changesets. It uses multi-agent orchestration to analyze changes and produce a structured document that helps humans:
- Understand the overall approach and intent
- Navigate changes in logical order
- Track review progress with checkboxes
- See how changes map to requirements (if provided)

**Primary audience**: Humans (the last line of defense on code changes)

**When to use**: Extremely large changesets that would take multiple hours for human review.

---

## Phase 0: Session State Verification

Before starting ANY work, verify the current session state.

### Step 1: Check for existing session

```bash
# Get current branch and sanitize for filesystem (replace / with -)
BRANCH_RAW=$(git branch --show-current)
BRANCH=$(echo "$BRANCH_RAW" | tr '/' '-')
DATE=$(date +%Y-%m-%d)
SESSION_DIR=".ocr/sessions/${DATE}-${BRANCH}"

ls -la "$SESSION_DIR" 2>/dev/null
```

### Step 2: If `--fresh` flag provided

Delete existing map artifacts and start fresh:
```bash
rm -rf "$SESSION_DIR/map"
mkdir -p "$SESSION_DIR/map/runs/run-1"
```

### Step 3: Map Run Resolution

Determine which map run to use (parallel to review rounds):

```bash
MAP_DIR="$SESSION_DIR/map/runs"

if [ ! -d "$MAP_DIR" ]; then
  CURRENT_RUN=1
  mkdir -p "$MAP_DIR/run-1"
else
  HIGHEST=$(ls -1 "$MAP_DIR" | grep -E '^run-[0-9]+$' | sed 's/run-//' | sort -n | tail -1)
  HIGHEST=${HIGHEST:-0}

  if [ -f "$MAP_DIR/run-$HIGHEST/map.md" ]; then
    CURRENT_RUN=$((HIGHEST + 1))
    mkdir -p "$MAP_DIR/run-$CURRENT_RUN"
  else
    CURRENT_RUN=$HIGHEST
  fi
fi
```

### Step 4: Initialize session state for map workflow

**CRITICAL**: Before proceeding, you MUST initialize the session in SQLite using `ocr state` commands.

If this is a **new session** (no prior review or map in this session):
```bash
ocr state init \
  --session-id "$SESSION_ID" \
  --branch "$BRANCH" \
  --workflow-type map \
  --session-dir "$SESSION_DIR"
```

Then transition to the first map phase:
```bash
ocr state transition \
  --phase "map-context" \
  --phase-number 1 \
  --current-map-run $CURRENT_RUN
```

If this is an **existing session** (e.g., a map after a prior review), the session already exists in SQLite — just call `ocr state transition` to switch to the map workflow:
```bash
ocr state transition \
  --phase "map-context" \
  --phase-number 1 \
  --current-map-run $CURRENT_RUN
```

The CLI commands handle timestamp management automatically — `map_started_at` is set when transitioning to a map phase, ensuring `ocr progress` shows accurate elapsed time even if the session had a prior review workflow.

### Step 5: Report to user

```
Session: {session_id}
Map run: {current_run}
Current phase: {current_phase}
Action: [Starting fresh | Resuming from Phase X]
```

---

## State Tracking

At **every phase transition**, call `ocr state transition` with the `--current-map-run` flag:

```bash
ocr state transition \
  --phase "flow-analysis" \
  --phase-number 3 \
  --current-map-run $CURRENT_RUN
```

This updates the session in SQLite and logs an orchestration event.

**Map phase values**: `map-context`, `topology`, `flow-analysis`, `requirements-mapping`, `synthesis`, `complete`

---

## Phase 1: Context Discovery (Shared with Review)

**Goal**: Build context from config + discovered files + user requirements.

**State**: Call `ocr state transition --phase "map-context" --phase-number 1 --current-map-run $CURRENT_RUN`

This phase is **identical** to the review workflow's context discovery. See `references/context-discovery.md` for the complete algorithm.

### Steps

1. **Load OCR Configuration** — Read `.ocr/config.yaml`
2. **Pull OpenSpec Context** — If enabled, read specs and active changes
3. **Discover Reference Files** — AGENTS.md, CLAUDE.md, etc.
4. **Gather Requirements** — If user provided specs/proposals/tickets
5. **Merge Into discovered-standards.md**

### Map-Specific: Load Redundancy Config

Read `code-review-map` section from `.ocr/config.yaml`:

```yaml
code-review-map:
  agents:
    flow_analysts: 2         # Range: 1-10, default: 2
    requirements_mappers: 2  # Range: 1-10, default: 2
```

**Parsing Logic**:
1. Read `.ocr/config.yaml`
2. Extract `code-review-map.agents.flow_analysts` → store as `FLOW_ANALYST_COUNT`
3. Extract `code-review-map.agents.requirements_mappers` → store as `REQ_MAPPER_COUNT`
4. If section is missing or commented out, use defaults: `FLOW_ANALYST_COUNT=2`, `REQ_MAPPER_COUNT=2`
5. Clamp values to range 1-10

**Use these values** when spawning agents in Phase 3 and Phase 4.

### Phase 1 Checkpoint

- [ ] `discovered-standards.md` written (or reused from existing session)
- [ ] If requirements provided: `requirements.md` written
- [ ] Agent redundancy config loaded
- [ ] `ocr state transition` called with `--phase "map-context"`

---

## Phase 2: Topology Analysis (Map Architect)

**Goal**: Enumerate changed files and identify logical structure.

**State**: Call `ocr state transition --phase "topology" --phase-number 2 --current-map-run $CURRENT_RUN`

### Steps

1. **Get the changeset** (determine target from user request):

   | Target | Command |
   |--------|---------|
   | Staged changes (default) | `git diff --cached --name-only` |
   | Unstaged changes | `git diff --name-only` |
   | Specific commit | `git diff {commit}^ {commit} --name-only` |
   | Commit range | `git diff {from}..{to} --name-only` |
   | Branch vs main | `git diff main...{branch} --name-only` |
   | PR (via gh CLI) | `gh pr diff {number} --name-only` |

   ```bash
   # Default: staged changes
   git diff --cached --name-only

   # Store canonical file list for completeness validation
   git diff --cached --name-only > /tmp/ocr-canonical-files.txt
   ```

   **CRITICAL**: Store this canonical file list. It's used for completeness validation in Phase 5.

2. **Categorize each file**:
   - Entry points (routes, handlers, CLI, UI components)
   - Core logic (business logic, services, domain)
   - Infrastructure (config, utilities, shared)
   - Tests
   - Documentation

3. **Identify logical sections**:
   - Group by feature boundary
   - Group by architectural layer
   - Group by execution flow
   - Group by concern (security, performance)

4. **Determine review order** within sections:
   - Entry points first
   - Core implementations next
   - Supporting files
   - Tests last

5. **Save topology to session**:
   ```
   .ocr/sessions/{id}/map/runs/run-{n}/topology.md
   ```

### Phase 2 Checkpoint

- [ ] All changed files enumerated
- [ ] Files categorized by type
- [ ] Logical sections identified
- [ ] `topology.md` written
- [ ] `ocr state transition` called with `--phase "topology"`

---

## Phase 3: Flow Tracing (Flow Analysts)

**Goal**: Trace upstream/downstream dependencies for each changed file.

**State**: Call `ocr state transition --phase "flow-analysis" --phase-number 3 --current-map-run $CURRENT_RUN`

### Steps

1. **Spawn Flow Analysts** — spawn `FLOW_ANALYST_COUNT` agents (from config, default: 2)

2. **Assign files** to each analyst (can overlap for coverage)

3. **Each analyst traces**:
   - Upstream: What calls this code?
   - Downstream: What does this code call?
   - Related: Tests, config, siblings

4. **Collect findings** from all analysts

5. **Aggregate with redundancy validation**:
   - Findings from multiple analysts = high confidence
   - Unique findings = lower confidence but still valid

6. **Save flow analysis**:
   ```
   .ocr/sessions/{id}/map/runs/run-{n}/flow-analysis.md
   ```

### Spawning Flow Analysts

For each analyst, provide:
- Their persona (`references/map-personas/flow-analyst.md`)
- Discovered standards
- Assigned files to trace
- Instructions to explore freely

See `references/map-personas/flow-analyst.md` for persona details.

### Phase 3 Checkpoint

- [ ] Flow Analysts spawned (`FLOW_ANALYST_COUNT` from config)
- [ ] All changed files have flow context
- [ ] Findings aggregated
- [ ] `flow-analysis.md` written
- [ ] `ocr state transition` called with `--phase "flow-analysis"`

---

## Phase 4: Requirements Mapping (If Provided)

**Goal**: Map changes to requirements and identify coverage.

**State**: Call `ocr state transition --phase "requirements-mapping" --phase-number 4 --current-map-run $CURRENT_RUN`

**Skip this phase** if no requirements were provided.

### Steps

1. **Spawn Requirements Mappers** — spawn `REQ_MAPPER_COUNT` agents (from config, default: 2)

2. **Provide context**:
   - Requirements from `requirements.md`
   - Changed files and their purposes (from topology)
   - Flow context (from Phase 3)

3. **Each mapper**:
   - Parses requirements into discrete items
   - Maps each change to relevant requirements
   - Identifies coverage status (full/partial/none)
   - Notes gaps and deviations

4. **Aggregate findings**:
   - Consistent mappings = high confidence
   - Divergent mappings = flag for human review

5. **Save requirements mapping**:
   ```
   .ocr/sessions/{id}/map/runs/run-{n}/requirements-mapping.md
   ```

### Phase 4 Checkpoint

- [ ] Requirements Mappers spawned (if requirements exist)
- [ ] Coverage matrix created
- [ ] Gaps identified
- [ ] `requirements-mapping.md` written
- [ ] `ocr state transition` called with `--phase "requirements-mapping"`

---

## Phase 5: Map Synthesis (Map Architect)

**Goal**: Combine all findings into the final Code Review Map optimized for reviewer workflow.

**State**: Call `ocr state transition --phase "synthesis" --phase-number 5 --current-map-run $CURRENT_RUN`

### Template Structure (in order)

1. **Executive Summary** — Context first
2. **Questions & Clarifications** — Ambiguities to resolve with author
3. **Requirements Coverage** — Coverage matrix (if requirements provided)
4. **Critical Review Focus** — High-value areas for human judgment
5. **Manual Verification** — Tests to run before/during review
6. **File Review** — Per-section file tracking (main tracking area)
7. **Section Dependencies** — Cross-section dependency graph data
8. **File Index** — Alphabetical reference
9. **Map Metadata** — Run info

### Steps

1. **Load all artifacts**:
   - `topology.md` — Section structure
   - `flow-analysis.md` — Dependency context
   - `requirements-mapping.md` — Coverage annotations (if exists)

2. **Construct Executive Summary**:
   - 1-2 paragraph narrative hypothesis
   - Key approaches observed
   - Frame as hypothesis, not assertion

3. **Gather Questions & Clarifications**:
   - Extract ambiguities from requirements mapping
   - List assumptions made during mapping
   - Include questions about deferred work or unclear intent

4. **Build Requirements Coverage** (if requirements provided):
   - Coverage matrix with status indicators
   - Note any gaps

5. **Generate Critical Review Focus**:
   - Identify areas where human judgment adds value
   - Focus on: business logic, security, edge cases, architectural decisions
   - Map each to requirement or concern
   - Do NOT perform code review — just flag areas for attention

6. **Generate Manual Verification**:
   - **Critical Path**: Happy-path tests from requirements
   - **Edge Cases & Error Handling**: From implementation analysis
   - **Non-Functional**: Performance, security checks
   - Omit only if changeset is purely docs/config

7. **Build File Review sections**:
   For each section from topology:
   - Narrative hypothesis (1-2 sentences)
   - File table with `Done` column (empty, reviewer marks `X`)
   - Flow summary
   - Requirements coverage
   - **Review Suggestions** (only if key things to watch for):
     - Specific areas mapped to requirements/concerns
     - Do NOT do code review — just flag for reviewer attention

8. **Generate Section Dependencies**:
   - Review flow analysis cross-file flows to identify section-to-section call chains
   - For each pair of sections with meaningful dependencies, add a table row
   - Direction: caller section → callee section
   - Relationship should be a 3-8 word description (e.g., "Auth middleware protects routes")
   - If sections are independent, leave the table body empty (headers only)

9. **Create File Index**:
   - Alphabetical list of ALL changed files
   - Section reference for each

10. **Validate completeness**:
   ```bash
   EXPECTED=$(git diff --cached --name-only | wc -l)
   MAPPED=$(grep -oE '\| `[^`]+` \|' map.md | wc -l)
   [ "$EXPECTED" -ne "$MAPPED" ] && echo "ERROR: Missing files!"
   ```

11. **Pipe structured map data to CLI**:

    Construct a JSON object with the map's structured data and pipe it to the CLI. The CLI validates, writes `map-meta.json`, and records a `map_completed` orchestration event — all in one command.

    ```bash
    cat <<'JSON' | ocr state map-complete --stdin
    {
      "schema_version": 1,
      "sections": [
        {
          "section_number": 1,
          "title": "Section Title",
          "description": "Section description",
          "files": [
            {
              "file_path": "src/example.ts",
              "role": "Entry point",
              "lines_added": 10,
              "lines_deleted": 2
            }
          ]
        }
      ],
      "dependencies": [
        {
          "from_section": 2,
          "from_title": "Tests",
          "to_section": 1,
          "to_title": "Core Logic",
          "relationship": "tests"
        }
      ]
    }
    JSON
    ```

    > The CLI validates the JSON schema, writes `map-meta.json` to the correct run directory, and records the event in SQLite. The orchestrator MUST NOT write `map-meta.json` directly.

12. **Save final map** (presentation artifact):
    ```
    .ocr/sessions/{id}/map/runs/run-{n}/map.md
    ```
    > `map.md` is the human-readable presentation artifact. The dashboard uses `map-meta.json` for structured data; `map.md` is stored as raw markdown for display and chat context.

### Map Output Format

See `references/map-template.md` for the complete template.

### Phase 5 Checkpoint

- [ ] Executive Summary with hypothesis
- [ ] Questions & Clarifications populated
- [ ] Requirements Coverage matrix (if applicable)
- [ ] Critical Review Focus areas identified
- [ ] Manual Verification tests generated (or omitted if docs-only)
- [ ] All File Review sections with file tables
- [ ] Review Suggestions per section (only where key things to flag)
- [ ] Section Dependencies table generated
- [ ] File Index complete
- [ ] Completeness validated (all files appear in tables)
- [ ] `map-meta.json` piped to CLI via `ocr state map-complete --stdin`
- [ ] `map.md` written
- [ ] `ocr state transition` called with `--phase "synthesis"`

---

## Phase 6: Present

**Goal**: Display the map to the user.

**State**: Call `ocr state transition --phase "complete" --phase-number 6 --current-map-run $CURRENT_RUN` after presenting.

### Steps

1. **Read the final map**:
   ```bash
   cat .ocr/sessions/{id}/map/runs/run-{n}/map.md
   ```

2. **Present to user** with summary:
   ```
   Code Review Map Generated

   Session: {session_id}
   Files mapped: {count}
   Sections: {section_count}

   The map is saved at: .ocr/sessions/{id}/map/runs/run-{n}/map.md

   [Display map content]
   ```

3. **Update state**:
   ```bash
   ocr state transition \
     --phase "complete" \
     --phase-number 6 \
     --current-map-run $CURRENT_RUN
   ```

   > **Note**: Map completion does NOT close the session — the session stays `active` so further reviews or maps can be run.

### Phase 6 Checkpoint

- [ ] Map presented to user
- [ ] `ocr state transition` called with `--phase "complete"`

## Aggregation Logic

When multiple agents produce findings, aggregate as follows:

### Flow Analyst Aggregation

1. **Collect** all flow analyses from all analysts
2. **Group** by file path
3. **Merge** upstream/downstream findings:
   - Union of all unique callers/callees
   - If same relationship found by multiple analysts = **High confidence**
   - If found by only one analyst = **Medium confidence** (still include)
4. **Resolve** section assignments:
   - If all analysts agree → use that section
   - If disagreement → use majority, note dissent
   - If no majority → Map Architect decides

### Requirements Mapper Aggregation

1. **Collect** all mappings from all mappers
2. **Compare** coverage assessments per requirement:
   - If all agree → use that status
   - If disagree → use **most conservative** (None < Partial < Full)
   - Note disagreements for human review
3. **Merge** file-to-requirement mappings (union)
4. **Compile** unified gaps list

### Confidence Scoring

| Agreement | Confidence |
|-----------|------------|
| All agents agree | High |
| Majority agrees | Medium |
| No agreement | Low (flag for review) |
