# OCR Review Workflow

Complete 8-phase process for multi-agent code review.

> **CRITICAL**: You MUST call `ocr state transition` **BEFORE starting work** on each phase. The `ocr progress` CLI reads session state for real-time tracking. Transition the `current_phase` and `phase_number` immediately when entering a new phase—do not wait until the phase is complete.

> **PREREQUISITE**: The `ocr` CLI must be installed (`npm install -g @open-code-review/cli`) or accessible via `npx`. Every phase transition calls `ocr state transition`, which requires the CLI.

---

## Phase 0: Session State Verification (ALWAYS DO FIRST)

Before starting ANY work, verify the current session state to avoid duplicating work or losing progress.

### Step 1: Check for existing session

```bash
# Get current branch and sanitize for filesystem (replace / with -)
BRANCH_RAW=$(git branch --show-current)
BRANCH=$(echo "$BRANCH_RAW" | tr '/' '-')
DATE=$(date +%Y-%m-%d)
SESSION_DIR=".ocr/sessions/${DATE}-${BRANCH}"

# Check if session exists
ls -la "$SESSION_DIR" 2>/dev/null
```

### Step 2: If `--fresh` flag provided

Delete the existing session and start from scratch:
```bash
rm -rf "$SESSION_DIR"
mkdir -p "$SESSION_DIR/rounds/round-1/reviews"
```
Then proceed to Phase 1.

### Step 3: If session exists, verify state matches files

Use `ocr state show` to read current state and verify actual files exist (see `references/session-files.md` for authoritative names):

```bash
ocr state show
```

| Phase Complete? | File check |
|-----------------|------------|
| context | `discovered-standards.md` exists |
| change-context | `context.md` exists |
| analysis | `context.md` has Tech Lead guidance section |
| reviews | ≥2 files in `rounds/round-{current_round}/reviews/` |
| discourse | `rounds/round-{current_round}/discourse.md` exists |
| synthesis | `rounds/round-{current_round}/final.md` exists |

> **Note**: Phase completion is derived from filesystem (file existence). The `current_phase` field in the session state indicates which phase is active, not what's complete.

### Step 3b: Round Resolution Algorithm

Determine which round to use:

```bash
ROUNDS_DIR="$SESSION_DIR/rounds"

# Count existing rounds
if [ ! -d "$ROUNDS_DIR" ]; then
  CURRENT_ROUND=1
  mkdir -p "$ROUNDS_DIR/round-1/reviews"
else
  # Find highest round number
  HIGHEST=$(ls -1 "$ROUNDS_DIR" | grep -E '^round-[0-9]+$' | sed 's/round-//' | sort -n | tail -1)
  HIGHEST=${HIGHEST:-0}

  # Check if highest round is complete (has final.md)
  if [ -f "$ROUNDS_DIR/round-$HIGHEST/final.md" ]; then
    # Start new round
    CURRENT_ROUND=$((HIGHEST + 1))
    mkdir -p "$ROUNDS_DIR/round-$CURRENT_ROUND/reviews"
  else
    # Resume existing round
    CURRENT_ROUND=$HIGHEST
  fi
fi
```

When starting a new round (CURRENT_ROUND > 1), pass the `--current-round` flag to `ocr state transition` so the CLI progress timer shows elapsed time for the current round, not the entire session.

### Step 4: Determine resume point

- **No state in SQLite, files exist**: Use `ocr state init` to recreate the session, then `ocr state transition` to set the correct phase based on file existence
- **State exists, files match**: Resume from `current_phase` shown by `ocr state show`
- **State and files mismatch**: Ask user which to trust
- **No session exists**: Create session directory and start Phase 1

### Step 5: Report to user

Before proceeding, tell the user:
```
Session: {session_id}
Current phase: {current_phase} (Phase {phase_number}/8)
Action: [Starting fresh | Resuming from Phase X]
```

---

## State Tracking

At **every phase transition**, call `ocr state transition`:

```bash
ocr state transition --phase "reviews" --phase-number 4 --current-round 1
```

This updates the session in SQLite and logs an orchestration event.

**Phase values**: `context`, `change-context`, `analysis`, `reviews`, `aggregation`, `discourse`, `synthesis`, `complete`

**Status values**: `active` (in progress), `closed` (complete — set via `ocr state close`)

## Artifact Checklist

> **See `references/session-files.md` for the authoritative file manifest.**

Before proceeding to each phase, verify the required artifacts exist:

| Phase | Required Before Starting | Artifact to Create |
|-------|-------------------------|-------------------|
| 1 | Session directory created | `discovered-standards.md`, `requirements.md` (if provided); call `ocr state init` |
| 2 | `discovered-standards.md` exists | `context.md`, `rounds/round-1/reviews/` directory; call `ocr state transition` |
| 3 | `context.md` exists | Update `context.md` with Tech Lead guidance; call `ocr state transition` |
| 4 | `context.md` exists | `rounds/round-{n}/reviews/{type}-{n}.md` for each reviewer; call `ocr state transition` |
| 5 | ≥2 files in `rounds/round-{n}/reviews/` | Aggregated findings (inline); call `ocr state transition` |
| 6 | Reviews complete | `rounds/round-{n}/discourse.md`; call `ocr state transition` |
| 7 | `rounds/round-{n}/discourse.md` exists | `rounds/round-{n}/round-meta.json`, `rounds/round-{n}/final.md`; call `ocr state round-complete` |
| 8 | `rounds/round-{n}/final.md` exists | Present to user; call `ocr state close` |

**NEVER skip directly to `final.md`** — this breaks progress tracking.

## Session Storage

**IMPORTANT**: Always store sessions in the project's `.ocr/sessions/` directory:

```bash
mkdir -p .ocr/sessions/{YYYY-MM-DD}-{branch}
```

This location is consistent regardless of how OCR is installed (CLI or plugin), enabling:
- `npx @open-code-review/cli progress` to track reviews in real-time
- `ocr history` and `ocr show` to access past sessions
- Cross-tool compatibility (same session visible from any AI tool)

## Phase 1: Context Discovery (Including Requirements)

**Goal**: Build review context from config + discovered files + user requirements.

**State**: Call `ocr state init` to create the session, then `ocr state transition --phase "context" --phase-number 1`:

```bash
# Initialize the session in SQLite
ocr state init \
  --session-id "$SESSION_ID" \
  --branch "$BRANCH" \
  --workflow-type review \
  --session-dir "$SESSION_DIR"

# Transition to context phase
ocr state transition --phase "context" --phase-number 1
```

### Steps

**1a. Load OCR Configuration**

Read `.ocr/config.yaml` for project-specific context and discovery settings:

```bash
cat .ocr/config.yaml
```

Extract:
- `context:` — Direct project context (injected into all reviews)
- `context_discovery.openspec` — OpenSpec integration settings
- `context_discovery.references` — Files to discover
- `rules:` — Per-severity review rules

**1b. Pull OpenSpec Context (if enabled)**

If `context_discovery.openspec.enabled: true`:

Read the `config` path from `.ocr/config.yaml` (defaults to `openspec/config.yaml`).
- For `.yaml` files: extract the `context` field
- For `.md` files: use entire content (legacy `openspec/project.md`)

```bash
# Read OpenSpec project context (path from .ocr/config.yaml openspec.config)
# Default: openspec/config.yaml, legacy: openspec/project.md
cat openspec/config.yaml 2>/dev/null || cat openspec/project.md 2>/dev/null

# Read merged specs for architectural context
find openspec/specs -name "*.md" -type f 2>/dev/null

# Check for active changes that affect the review
find openspec/changes -name "*.md" -type f 2>/dev/null
```

**1c. Discover Reference Files**

Read files listed in `context_discovery.references`:

```bash
# Check for AI assistant configuration
cat AGENTS.md 2>/dev/null
cat CLAUDE.md 2>/dev/null
cat .cursorrules 2>/dev/null
cat .windsurfrules 2>/dev/null

# Check for contribution guidelines
cat CONTRIBUTING.md 2>/dev/null

# Check for OpenSpec instructions (legacy projects)
cat openspec/AGENTS.md 2>/dev/null
```

**1d. Gather User-Provided Requirements**

Recognize requirements from ANY of these forms:
- **Inline**: "review this against the requirement that..."
- **Document reference**: "see the spec at path/to/spec.md" → Read the file
- **Pasted text**: Bug reports, acceptance criteria, notes
- **Ambiguous reference**: "check the auth spec" → Search for likely files or ask user

If requirements provided, save to `requirements.md` in session directory.

**1e. Merge Into discovered-standards.md**

```markdown
# Discovered Project Standards

## OCR Config Context
[content from .ocr/config.yaml context field]

## OpenSpec Context
[content from openspec/config.yaml]

## From: AGENTS.md
[content]

## From: CLAUDE.md
[content]

## Review Rules
[rules from .ocr/config.yaml]
```

See `references/context-discovery.md` for detailed algorithm.

### Phase 1 Checkpoint

**STOP and verify before proceeding:**
- [ ] `discovered-standards.md` written to session directory
- [ ] If user provided requirements: `requirements.md` written

---

## Phase 2: Gather Change Context

**Goal**: Understand what changed and why.

**State**: Call `ocr state transition --phase "change-context" --phase-number 2`

### Steps

1. Identify the review target:
   - Staged changes: `git diff --cached`
   - Unstaged changes: `git diff`
   - Commit range: `git diff {range}`
   - PR: `gh pr diff {number}`

2. Gather supporting context:
   ```bash
   # Get the diff
   git diff --cached > /tmp/ocr-diff.txt

   # Get recent commit messages for intent
   git log --oneline -10

   # Get branch name
   git branch --show-current

   # List affected files
   git diff --cached --name-only
   ```

3. Create session directory:
   ```bash
   SESSION_ID="$(date +%Y-%m-%d)-$(git branch --show-current | tr '/' '-')"
   mkdir -p .ocr/sessions/$SESSION_ID/rounds/round-1/reviews
   ```

4. Save context to `context.md`:
   ```markdown
   # Review Context

   **Session**: {SESSION_ID}
   **Target**: staged changes
   **Branch**: {branch}
   **Files**: {count} files changed

   ## Change Summary
   [Brief description of what changed]

   ## Affected Files
   - path/to/file1.ts
   - path/to/file2.ts
   ```

### Phase 2 Checkpoint

**STOP and verify before proceeding:**
- [ ] Session directory created: `.ocr/sessions/{id}/`
- [ ] `rounds/round-1/reviews/` subdirectory created
- [ ] `context.md` written with change summary

---

## Phase 3: Tech Lead Analysis

**Goal**: Summarize changes, analyze against requirements, identify risks, select reviewers.

**State**: Call `ocr state transition --phase "analysis" --phase-number 3`

### Steps

1. **Check for existing map reference** (optional):

   If user explicitly references an existing map (e.g., "I've already generated a map", "use the map I created", "check the map in this session"):

   ```bash
   # Check for existing map artifacts
   ls .ocr/sessions/{id}/map/runs/*/map.md 2>/dev/null
   ```

   - **If found AND user referenced it**: Read the latest `map.md` as supplementary context
   - **If not found**: Inform user no map exists, proceed with standard review
   - **If user did NOT reference a map**: Do NOT automatically use map artifacts

   > **Note**: Maps are orthogonal tools. Only use if explicitly referenced by user.

2. Review requirements (if provided):
   - What is the code SUPPOSED to do?
   - What are the acceptance criteria?
   - What edge cases are implied?

3. Analyze the diff to understand:
   - What functionality is being added/changed/removed?
   - Does this align with requirements?
   - What is the likely intent?
   - What are the potential risk areas?

4. Create dynamic guidance for reviewers:
   ```markdown
   ## Tech Lead Guidance

   ### Requirements Summary (if provided)
   The changes should implement OAuth2 authentication per spec...
   Key acceptance criteria:
   - Users can log in via Google OAuth
   - Session tokens expire after 24 hours
   - Failed logins are rate-limited

   ### Change Summary
   This PR adds user authentication via OAuth2...

   ### Requirements Assessment
   - OAuth login: Implemented
   - Token expiry: Not visible in diff - verify implementation
   - Rate limiting: Not found - may be missing

   ### Clarifying Questions (Tech Lead)
   - The spec says "fast response" - what's the target latency?
   - Should this include account lockout after N failures?

   ### Risk Areas
   - **Security**: New auth flow needs careful review
   - **Architecture**: New service layer pattern

   ### Focus Points
   - Validate token handling
   - Check for proper error handling
   - Ensure tests cover edge cases
   - Verify rate limiting is implemented
   ```

4. **Read reviewer team from config** (REQUIRED):

   ```bash
   # MUST read default_team from .ocr/config.yaml - do NOT use hardcoded values
   cat .ocr/config.yaml | grep -A10 'default_team:'
   ```

   Parse the `default_team` section to determine reviewer counts:
   ```yaml
   # Example config - actual values come from .ocr/config.yaml
   default_team:
     principal: 2    # Spawn principal-1, principal-2
     quality: 2      # Spawn quality-1, quality-2
     # security: 1   # Commented = not spawned by default
     testing: 1      # Spawn testing-1
   ```

   **Reviewer spawning rules**:
   - For each uncommented entry in `default_team`, spawn N instances
   - `principal: 2` → spawn `principal-1`, `principal-2`
   - `quality: 2` → spawn `quality-1`, `quality-2`
   - `testing: 1` → spawn `testing-1`
   - Commented entries (e.g., `# security: 1`) are NOT spawned unless auto-detected

   **Auto-detection** (adds reviewers beyond config):
   | Change Type | Additional Reviewers |
   |-------------|---------------------|
   | Auth/Security changes | + 1x Security |
   | API changes | + 1x Security |
   | Logic changes | + 1x Testing (if not in config) |
   | User says "add security" | + 1x Security |

5. **Handle `--team` override** (if provided):

   If the user passed `--team reviewer-id:count,...`, use those reviewers **instead of** `default_team` from config. Parse the comma-separated list into reviewer IDs and counts.

6. **Handle `--reviewer` ephemeral reviewers** (if provided):

   Each `--reviewer "..."` value adds one ephemeral reviewer to the team. These are **in addition to** library reviewers (from `--team` or `default_team`).

   For each `--reviewer` value:
   - Synthesize a focused reviewer persona from the description (see below)
   - Spawn with redundancy 1 (ephemeral reviewers are inherently unique)
   - Output file: `ephemeral-{n}.md` (e.g., `ephemeral-1.md`, `ephemeral-2.md`)

   **Synthesizing an ephemeral persona**: Use the description to create a focused reviewer identity. For example, `--reviewer "Focus on error handling in the auth flow"` becomes a reviewer whose persona is: "You are reviewing this code with a specific focus on error handling patterns in the authentication flow. Evaluate error propagation, edge cases, failure modes, and recovery paths." The persona should be specific enough to guide the review but broad enough to catch related issues.

---

## Phase 4: Spawn Reviewers

**Goal**: Run each reviewer independently with configured redundancy.

**State**: Call `ocr state transition --phase "reviews" --phase-number 4 --current-round $CURRENT_ROUND`

> **CRITICAL**: Reviewer counts and types come from `.ocr/config.yaml` `default_team` section.
> Do NOT use hardcoded defaults. Do NOT skip the `-{n}` suffix in filenames.
> See `references/session-files.md` for authoritative file naming.

### Steps

1. Load reviewer personas from `references/reviewers/`.

2. **Parse `default_team` from config** (already read in Phase 3):

   For each reviewer type in config, spawn the specified number of instances:

   ```bash
   # Example: If config says principal: 2, quality: 2, testing: 1
   # You MUST spawn exactly these reviewers with numbered suffixes:

   # From default_team.principal: 2
   -> Create: rounds/round-$CURRENT_ROUND/reviews/principal-1.md
   -> Create: rounds/round-$CURRENT_ROUND/reviews/principal-2.md

   # From default_team.quality: 2
   -> Create: rounds/round-$CURRENT_ROUND/reviews/quality-1.md
   -> Create: rounds/round-$CURRENT_ROUND/reviews/quality-2.md

   # From default_team.testing: 1
   -> Create: rounds/round-$CURRENT_ROUND/reviews/testing-1.md

   # Auto-detected (if applicable)
   -> Create: rounds/round-$CURRENT_ROUND/reviews/security-1.md
   ```

   **File naming pattern**: `{type}-{n}.md` where n starts at 1.

   Examples: `principal-1.md`, `principal-2.md`, `quality-1.md`, `quality-2.md`, `testing-1.md`

3. **Spawn ephemeral reviewers** (if `--reviewer` was provided):

   For each ephemeral reviewer, create a task with a synthesized persona (no `.md` file lookup). The task receives the same context as library reviewers but uses the synthesized persona instead of a file-based one.

   ```bash
   # From --reviewer "Focus on error handling"
   -> Create: rounds/round-$CURRENT_ROUND/reviews/ephemeral-1.md

   # From --reviewer "Review as a junior developer"
   -> Create: rounds/round-$CURRENT_ROUND/reviews/ephemeral-2.md
   ```

   See `references/reviewer-task.md` for the ephemeral reviewer task variant.

4. Each task receives:
   - Reviewer persona (from `references/reviewers/{name}.md` for library reviewers, or synthesized for ephemeral)
   - Project context (from `discovered-standards.md`)
   - **Requirements context (from `requirements.md` if provided)**
   - Tech Lead guidance (including requirements assessment)
   - The diff to review
   - **Instruction to explore codebase with full agency**

5. Save each review to `.ocr/sessions/{id}/rounds/round-{current_round}/reviews/{type}-{n}.md`.

See `references/reviewer-task.md` for the task template.

### Phase 4 Checkpoint — MANDATORY VALIDATION

**Run this validation command before proceeding:**

```bash
# Set these based on your current session
SESSION_DIR=".ocr/sessions/$(ls -1t .ocr/sessions/ | head -1)"
CURRENT_ROUND=$(ls -1d "$SESSION_DIR/rounds/round-"* 2>/dev/null | wc -l | tr -d ' ')
REVIEWS_DIR="$SESSION_DIR/rounds/round-$CURRENT_ROUND/reviews"

echo "Validating: $REVIEWS_DIR"
ls -la "$REVIEWS_DIR/"

# Verify all files match {slug}-{n}.md pattern
for f in "$REVIEWS_DIR/"*.md; do
  if [[ "$(basename "$f")" =~ ^[a-z][a-z0-9-]*-[0-9]+\.md$ ]]; then
    echo "OK $(basename "$f")"
  else
    echo "FAIL $(basename "$f") does not match {slug}-{n}.md pattern"
    exit 1
  fi
done

REVIEWER_COUNT=$(ls -1 "$REVIEWS_DIR/"*.md 2>/dev/null | wc -l | tr -d ' ')
echo "OK Found $REVIEWER_COUNT reviewer files"
```

**STOP and verify before proceeding:**
- [ ] Review files exist for EACH entry in `default_team` config
- [ ] File count matches sum of all `default_team` values
- [ ] All files use `{type}-{n}.md` pattern
- [ ] Each review file contains findings

---

## Phase 5: Aggregate Findings

**Goal**: Merge redundant reviewer runs and mark confidence.

**State**: Call `ocr state transition --phase "aggregation" --phase-number 5 --current-round $CURRENT_ROUND`

### Steps

1. For reviewers with redundancy > 1, compare findings:
   - **Confirmed**: Found in all runs → Very High Confidence
   - **Partial**: Found in some runs → Medium Confidence
   - **Single**: Found in one run → Lower Confidence

2. Deduplicate identical findings.

3. Create aggregated findings per reviewer:
   ```markdown
   ## Security Reviewer (2 runs)

   ### Confirmed Findings (2/2 runs)
   - SQL injection risk in query builder [VERY HIGH]

   ### Partial Findings (1/2 runs)
   - Potential timing attack in comparison [MEDIUM]
   ```

---

## Phase 6: Discourse

**Goal**: Let reviewers challenge and build on each other's findings.

**State**: Call `ocr state transition --phase "discourse" --phase-number 6 --current-round $CURRENT_ROUND`

> Skip this phase if `--quick` flag is used.

### Steps

1. Present all aggregated findings to each reviewer.

2. Each reviewer responds using these types:
   - **AGREE**: "I concur with Security's SQL injection finding..."
   - **CHALLENGE**: "I disagree because the ORM sanitizes..."
   - **CONNECT**: "This relates to my maintainability concern..."
   - **SURFACE**: "Based on this discussion, I notice..."

3. Save discourse to `.ocr/sessions/{id}/rounds/round-{current_round}/discourse.md`.

See `references/discourse.md` for detailed instructions.

### Phase 6 Checkpoint

**STOP and verify before proceeding:**
- [ ] `rounds/round-{n}/discourse.md` written to round directory
- [ ] Contains AGREE/CHALLENGE/CONNECT/SURFACE responses
- [ ] (Or if `--quick` flag: skip this phase, proceed to synthesis)

---

## Phase 7: Synthesis

**Goal**: Produce final prioritized review and save to **`final.md`**.

**State**: Call `ocr state transition --phase "synthesis" --phase-number 7 --current-round $CURRENT_ROUND`

> **File**: `rounds/round-{n}/final.md`
> **Template**: See `references/final-template.md` for format
> **Manifest**: See `references/session-files.md` for authoritative file names

### Steps

1. Aggregate all findings from Phase 5 and Phase 6.

2. Deduplicate and merge related findings.

3. Weight by confidence:
   - Confirmed by redundancy: +2
   - Agreed in discourse: +1
   - Challenged and defended: +1
   - Challenged and undefended: -1

4. Categorize findings into three sections (see `references/final-template.md` for criteria):
   - **Blockers**: Security vulnerabilities, data integrity risks, correctness bugs, breaking changes — must resolve before merge
   - **Should Fix**: Code quality issues, potential bugs, missing validation, important refactors — address before or shortly after merge
   - **Suggestions**: Style preferences, minor refactors, documentation, testing ideas — author's discretion
   - **What's Working Well**: Positive feedback (separate encouragement section, not counted)

5. **If requirements were provided**, include Requirements Assessment:
   - Which requirements are fully met?
   - Which requirements have gaps?
   - Any deviations from requirements?
   - Confidence level in requirements fulfillment

6. **Collect and surface Clarifying Questions** from Tech Lead and all reviewers:
   - Questions about requirements ambiguity
   - Questions about scope boundaries
   - Questions about edge cases
   - Questions about intentional exclusions

   These go in a prominent "Clarifying Questions" section for stakeholder response.

7. **Pipe structured round data to the CLI (BEFORE `final.md`)**:

   > The CLI is the **sole writer** of `round-meta.json`. The orchestrator constructs JSON in memory and pipes it to the CLI, which validates the schema, writes the file to the correct session path, and records a `round_completed` orchestration event — all in one command.

   Construct the JSON from your **post-synthesis conclusions**, then pipe to the CLI.

   > **CRITICAL — Category reflects synthesis, not original reviewer tags**: The `category` field on each finding must match the final synthesized classification — NOT the category the individual reviewer originally used. If discourse or synthesis promoted a `should_fix` to `blocker` (or demoted a `blocker` to `should_fix`), the JSON you pipe here MUST use the **promoted/demoted category**. The dashboard derives all counts from these categories. If they don't match `final.md`, the dashboard will show wrong numbers.

   > **CRITICAL — `synthesis_counts` must match `final.md`**: The `synthesis_counts` object contains the **deduplicated** counts of items in each section of `final.md`. Multiple reviewers often flag the same issue independently, so the per-reviewer findings array will have more entries than `final.md` lists. Count the actual numbered items under each section heading in your synthesized review (`## Blockers`, `## Should Fix`, `## Suggestions`) and set those counts here. The dashboard uses `synthesis_counts` when present, falling back to derived counts only for older reviews.

   ```bash
   cat <<'JSON' | ocr state round-complete --stdin
   {
     "schema_version": 1,
     "verdict": "REQUEST CHANGES",
     "synthesis_counts": {
       "blockers": 1,
       "should_fix": 3,
       "suggestions": 5
     },
     "reviewers": [
       {
         "type": "principal",
         "instance": 1,
         "severity_high": 1,
         "severity_medium": 4,
         "severity_low": 2,
         "severity_info": 0,
         "findings": [
           {
             "title": "SQL Injection in query builder",
             "category": "blocker",
             "severity": "high",
             "file_path": "src/db/query.ts",
             "line_start": 42,
             "line_end": 45,
             "summary": "User input passed directly to raw SQL...",
             "flagged_by": ["@principal-1", "@security-1"]
           }
         ]
       }
     ]
   }
   JSON
   ```

   The CLI will:
   1. Validate the JSON schema (schema_version, verdict, synthesis_counts, reviewers, findings)
   2. Write `round-meta.json` to `{session_dir}/rounds/round-{n}/round-meta.json`
   3. Use `synthesis_counts` for dashboard display (falls back to derived counts if absent)
   4. Record a `round_completed` orchestration event in SQLite

   **`synthesis_counts`**: Count the actual numbered items (`### 1.`, `### 2.`, etc.) under each section of `final.md`. This is the **deduplicated** count after merging cross-reviewer duplicates.

   **Finding categories**: `"blocker"` | `"should_fix"` | `"suggestion"` | `"style"`
   **Finding severity**: `"critical"` | `"high"` | `"medium"` | `"low"` | `"info"`

   Optional flags: `--session-id <id>` (auto-detects active session), `--round <number>` (auto-detects current round).

   > **Do NOT write `round-meta.json` directly** — always pipe through the CLI so the schema is validated and the event is recorded atomically.

8. **Write the final review file**:
   ```bash
   # OUTPUT FILE - must be exactly this path:
   FINAL_FILE="$SESSION_DIR/rounds/round-$CURRENT_ROUND/final.md"
   ```

   Save synthesized review to `$FINAL_FILE`.

   See `references/final-template.md` for the template format.

### Phase 7 Checkpoint — MANDATORY VALIDATION

**Run this validation command before proceeding:**

```bash
# Set these based on your current session
SESSION_DIR=".ocr/sessions/$(ls -1t .ocr/sessions/ | head -1)"
CURRENT_ROUND=$(ls -1d "$SESSION_DIR/rounds/round-"* 2>/dev/null | wc -l | tr -d ' ')
ROUND_META="$SESSION_DIR/rounds/round-$CURRENT_ROUND/round-meta.json"
FINAL_FILE="$SESSION_DIR/rounds/round-$CURRENT_ROUND/final.md"

# Check round-meta.json exists
if [ -f "$ROUND_META" ]; then
  echo "OK round-meta.json exists at $ROUND_META"
else
  echo "FAIL round-meta.json not found at $ROUND_META"
  exit 1
fi

# Check final.md exists
if [ -f "$FINAL_FILE" ]; then
  echo "OK final.md exists at $FINAL_FILE"
else
  echo "FAIL final.md not found at $FINAL_FILE"

## Phase 8: Present

**Goal**: Display results, optionally post to GitHub, and close the session.

**State**: Call `ocr state close` after presenting results.

### Steps

1. Display the final review in a clear format:
   ```markdown
   # Code Review: {branch}

   ## Summary
   {X} blockers, {Y} should-fix, {Z} suggestions

   ## Blockers
   ...

   ## Should Fix
   ...
   ```

2. If `--post` flag or PR target:
   - Check for `gh` CLI: `which gh`
   - Post as PR comment: `gh pr comment {number} --body-file final.md`

3. **Close the session**:
   ```bash
   ocr state close
   ```

   This sets `status: "closed"` and `current_phase: "complete"` in SQLite.

   > **IMPORTANT**: Closing the session ensures:
   > - The `ocr progress` CLI stops showing this session
   > - The session won't be picked up for resume
   > - The session remains accessible via `/ocr-history` and `/ocr-show`

4. Confirm session saved:
   ```
   Review complete
   -> .ocr/sessions/{id}/rounds/round-{n}/final.md
   ```
